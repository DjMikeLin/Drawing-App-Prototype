# Drawing-App-Prototype
Based off Homework 4 from Windowing Systems Programming. This prototype adds additional features consisting of additional shapes. 
Original homework requirements will be attached as a PDF. And, at a later time, mvvm, save, load, more shapes, and etc will be added.

Current Features:
Available shapes to draw: Rectangle, any ellispe including circles, straight lines, dots, pencil draw, right triangle, and triangle in 
exact order in Shape combobox. 

Colors: All colors in the SolidColorBrush class in wpf are available for fill color and stroke color. 

Stroke Thickness Setting:  stroke thickness can be changed via a textbox with any integer. User will be prompted to enter another character
each time a non-integer char is entered into the textbox. 

----Main currently contains 3 buttons with corresponding key inputs that allow users to do the same thing as clicking it. 

Reset lets the user start over with a new drawing Canvas. Exit allows user to terminate app. Lastly, save does not work at this time. 

Future updates/commits will add save, load, more shapes, and etc to the app.
